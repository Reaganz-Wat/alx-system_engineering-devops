## 0-alias

This script creates an alias called `ls` that deletes all files in the current directory (`rm *`). Once sourced, any use of `ls` will result in file deletion. This is a dangerous alias and should be used only for demonstration.

To disable it temporarily, use `\ls` to access the real `ls` binary.
